# Car Price Prediction
In this project scrape cars data from Pakwheels.com using selenium scraping
Total rows in dataset were 4600
Preprocessed using Pandas and removed the irrelevent data from the csv
After preprocessing i have performed EDA to see the correlation e.g CC, Year, Transmission and City etc
Then I have trained 4 models using Random Forest, KNN, Linear Regression and Lasso Regression
Model can be used by car rentals, car sellers and buyers
User dont have to scroll through all the pages and do the hustle just have to enter the details and model will predict the approximate price in specific city
